## Open Questions / Things to Discuss with Tutor

- What exactly are the deliverables for this project?
- How essential is Dutch fluency, and for what parts of the task?
- Are we expected to transcribe and annotate the video recordings ourselves?
- How do we access and interpret the teacher observations?
- What technologies are acceptable or recommended for video/audio/NLP analysis?
- Are there any examples or previous projects we can refer to?

## Tech Stack (Tentative)

- **Languages**: Python
- **Libraries**:
    - `OpenCV` – for video analysis
    - `Whisper` – for speech-to-text
    - `spaCy` – for NLP pattern detection
    - `pandas`, `numpy` – for data wrangling
    - `Matplotlib`, `Plotly` – for visualization
- **Tools**:
    - GitHub
    - Code editor of choice (VS Code, Zed, Neovim)
    - Jupyter for prototyping
    - Discord/WhatsApp for comms
- **Infrastructure**: Local dev environment for now, optional Docker setup later
